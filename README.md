### What I learned

while doing this challenge i learned two major things regarding html,css
1.what is data attribute and how to use them.
2.what is aria and why we use them and how to use them.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.mobile-nav-toggle[aria-expanded="true"] {
  background-image: url("./assets/images/icon-close-menu.svg");
  width: 1.5rem;
}
.navbar-slider[data-visibility="true"] {
  transform: translateX(0%);
}
```
